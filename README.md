# Spaceship Game Additions

This is a revised version of the game we showed during class.
* In this version the map has boundaries on the top and bottom parts.
* The player can warp between the right side to the left side and vice versa.
* The player can preform a dodge essentially dodge the incomming enemies and destroy them.

## Player Keybinds
* Arrow Keys for movement
* Shift to dodge
* Spacebar to shoot
